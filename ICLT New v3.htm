   <h1>ICLT (Information, Communication and Learning Technology) Usage Agreement
            for Students
         </h1>
         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>This agreement covers the use of ICLT facilities provided
            and maintained by Thomas Rotherham College. Its purpose is to ensure that all
            ICLT facilities are used in a responsible manner and in a way that covers
            current legislation, such as the Computer Misuse Act. This document is a guide
            as to what is deemed &apos;acceptable use&apos; and the consequences of any misuse. All
            access to these facilities is monitored and logged so that this agreement can
            be enforced effectively.
         </p>
         <p>The College has the right to monitor any and all aspects of
            its telephone and computer systems that are made available to you and to
            monitor, intercept and/or record any communications made by staff, students and
            visitors including telephones, e-mail or Internet communications.  To ensure
            compliance with this policy or for any other purpose authorised under the
            Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications)
            Regulations 2000 users are hereby required to expressly consent to the College
            doing so.
         </p>
         <p>In line with the College&apos;s various statutory duties under
            Safeguarding/Child Protection and under the Prevent agenda concerning the need
            to prevent people from being drawn into extremism and/or terrorism, the College
            would need to refer certain suspicious searches or communications to the
            relevant authorities- police, Local Authority -  in circumstances where these
            gave rise to concerns about the safety and well-being of students and/or
            others.
         </p>
         <p>The college uses classroom management software (currently AB Tutor) to allow staff to monitor computer usage.</p>
         <dl>
            <dt>This includes abilities such as:</dt>
            <dd>Remotely viewing/recording your screen</dd>
            <dd>Freezing your access to the computer and taking control of it</dd>
            <dd>Monitoring open applications and web sites</dd>
            <dd>Blocking access to applications, web sites or the internet</dd>
         </dl>
         <p>In addition the College wishes to make you aware that close
            circuit television (CCTV) is in operation for the protection of all users of
            the College and also to protect College assets from theft and vandalism.
         </p>
         <p>Violation of the terms of this agreement is likely to result
            in disciplinary or other appropriate action being taken by the College.<br/>
         </p>
         <dl>
            <dt>ICLT facilities include:</dt>
            <dd>Hardware</dd>
            <dd>Software</dd>
            <dd>Systems and services (including the intranet, phones and e-mail)</dd>
            <dd>Peripherals (including printers and scanners)</dd>
         </dl>	 
		 
		 
         <ol class="outer">
            <li>General Usage
			<aside>You must not cause damage of any kind to College ICLT facilities. Use a strong password and keep it private, never let anyone use your account or use theirs. 
			When using College computers, you must not install/download software, attach laptops/mobile phones or eat and drink.	
			Save your work to OneDrive unless told otherwise by staff. 
			All student work saved to the College network is deleted at the end of the year - so you must back this up. The space available for you to save your work on the College network is limited. 
			You must manage this and delete unwanted files. OneDrive is unlimited.</aside> 				
            <ol>
               <li>
                  You must not cause any form of damage
                  to ICLT facilities. The term &apos;damage&apos; includes modifications to hardware or
                  software that, whilst not permanently harming the hardware or software, incur
                  time and/or cost in restoring the system to its original state.				
               </li>
               <li>
                  You must ensure that your username
                  and password remain private. You may be held responsible for any inappropriate
                  use or activity carried out using your account details, so if you suspect that
                  someone has discovered your account details you must inform the Computer
                  Services department immediately. Please ensure that:		
                  <ul>
                     <li>You do not leave your account details in public view</li>
                     <li>Use a strong password that does not contain identifying information such as your student ID number, date of birth or name</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  You must not attempt by any method to discover another person&apos;s account details or attempt to gain access to any of
                  the College&apos;s systems using anything other than your assigned username and password.
               </li>
               <li>
                  You must use OneDrive for as your primary storage which can be easily accessed at
                  <a href="https://onedrive.live.com">https://onedrive.live.com</a> or <a href="https://thomroth.mydaycloud.com">https://thomroth.mydaycloud.com</a>
                  Additional network drives are allocated to some courses, your teacher will
                  inform you if you are on one of these courses and instruct you where to save.
                  Work/data saved on the computer&apos;s hard drive (i.e. C:\ drive, This PC,
                  Libraries) may be lost when the computer is re-booted, or cleared as a result
                  of regular maintenance carried out by Computer Services.  Home Drives (Z:),
                  departmental drives and course specific drives are backed up by the College and
                  can be restored by Computer Services.  Students are encouraged to perform
                  regular backups of anything stored on OneDrive, as the college is
                  unable to restore data stored in this location.  <strong>Please note – all student
                  drives and collaborative shared drives will be deleted at the end of each
                  academic year.  It is the individual student&apos;s responsibility to make copies of
                  any files they wish to carry over to the next year.  Office365 accounts
                  (location of OneDrive and  student email) for students are deleted at the end
                  of December after you leave.</strong> The College reserves the
                  right to inspect and access the contents of users&apos; home drives (Z:) at any

                  or archive any old or unwanted files to save disk space. The amount of space
                  you have available may be limited by the allocation of a Disk Quota.  Under
                  special circumstances this may be increased at the discretion of the Computer

               <li>The College reserves the right to
                  retain copies of all e-mails sent and received and to use the contents as
                  evidence in any disciplinary process. The College reserves the right to access
                  and disclose the contents of a user&apos;s e-mails in accordance with its legal and
                  audit obligations.

               <li>
                  Repeated sending of unsolicited e-mail to groups or individuals, whether internal or external, after being requested to stop will be considered inappropriate use of e-mail facilities.

               </li>
               <li>
                  E-mails should be drafted with care.
                  Due to the informal nature of e-mail, it is easy to forget that it is a
                  permanent form of written communication and that material can be recovered even
                  when it is deleted from your computer.
